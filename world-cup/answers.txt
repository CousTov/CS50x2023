Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Prediction for the first and second simulations where the number of simulated tournament were significantly low proved to be wrong.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 10,000 simulations, the winner remained the same and the predictions (winning %) of the given teams were some what stable, albeit with minute ups and downs. Thus, I believe a simulation of 10,000 to be "good enough" for this particular program.
